      <p>When I woke I was able to watch the sun rise, as the horizon gave birth to the light of day, I
          marveled at how infinitely it stretched. Dark violet clouds standing sentinel over the sea and its
          inhabitants. The early morning light cast an aura of orange and purple over the ocean, creating a
          mosaic of colors, as light bounced randomly off the ocean swells. Although I knew that beyond
          the horizon, laid blasted earth colored red by the remains of the soldiers that stood before it. I
          could find comfort that at least for now, the ocean was calm.
          <br>I inspected my jet, a Vickers-Supermarine Mk1 Spitfire, I made sure that the fuel levels
          were right. Whenever, I looked at the gunner I was in awe at the size of the shells it took, and the
          size of the barrell.
          <br>“All good, sir” The old voice of the head mechanic ringed, he walked behind me to see what I
          was looking at.
          <br>“Uh, yes...” I staggered taking a few steps back away from the aircraft, truthfully I never
          actually knew what to check on the last inspection. I only ever looked at the fuel level.
          <br>“Don’t listen to him Ronald,” My partner, Charles chimed in with a cocky smirk on his face as
          he climbed upon his plane without giving it a second look. “The bloke doesn’t even know what
          to look for, he just knows how to fly the thing.”
          <br>The mechanic laughed “Right, them” and walked away, clipboard and hands clasped behind his
          back chuckling to himself.
          On the side of Charles’ jet were markings of all the kills he had. 15. I looked at mine. 1. And the
          kill was not truthfully mine either. It came when a German plane snuck up on me, and while I
          was dead in his sights he sputtered out of the air and without ejecting he crashed into the ocean.
          On my way back to base I shot some rounds out of my gunner, and I concocted a story of the
          near death experience as one of my own heroism. So, I marked it. I didn’t want to be the only
          one without any kills. I think about that pilot from time to time. I have a family to go home to,
          and I wondered if he did too. A family that would miss him, perhaps a wife, kids. A part of me
          died with him that day. It’s absurd how things work out like that sometimes.
          <br>“Ready then!” Charles shouted as he closed the cockpit.
          <br>I looked at him and nodded. “Ready.” I tugged my mask closed.
          <br>With the roar of our engines we ascended into the sky until land and our base had become only
          speck in our rear view.
          <br>Mere minutes after I was radioed by Charles,
          <br>“Listen, my engine is crapping out on me. I’ll have to turn back.” he buzzed
          <br>“Alright then.” I started to make the necessary preparations to turn back to base.
          <br>“Are you going to stay on course?” he said, in his voice was that cockiness again, somewhat
          expecting me to say no.
          <br>“I will” Canceling my preparations, I said with a certain sense of unease.
          <br>“Right then” he said
          <br>“I’ll see you soon” I looked out and could see him turning back to base. Above me was the clear
          blue sky, below me was the ocean, cascading into nothing for miles.
          <br>Overcome with a sudden longing, I focused my attention to the nothingness ahead. I marveled at
          how barren the surface of the water looked, yet just beneath the surface a limitless variety of life
          flourished. There was no line where the ocean met the sky, just blue. The sky and the ocean on
          the surface were the same, but what happens down below could never match the atrocities
          committed above.
          <br>The Luftwaffe descended upon me with no warning, aiming for my back side. With an
          adroit twist of my planes body, however, I was able to narrowly avoid the large bullets of the
          aircraft. I could see the German Heinkel 111 clearly in my rearview, meanicingly flying above
          me. The large gunners from the sides of its cockpit, protruded cruelly from the vicious plane,
          making it much more deadly than mine. It had a yellow paint on it, crudely spotted on either end.
          In the distance I could see what he was protecting, a German Cargo many Kilometers ahead of
          me.
          <br>As the Hienkel struggled to turn around to strike at me again, I made a single kick toward the
          sky. Once I was higher than him, I twisted back around so that I could face him, my hand on the
          triggers poised for attack. He came to face me as he spun around with a vicious contortion of his
          planes body. I saw through the cockpit the pilot staring up at me. He seemed to be taunting me,
          inviting me to attempt an attack. He fired and with some hesitation so did I. We were both struck
          and on a course downward. The wing on my left side had been hit and my engine had been cut. I
          tried to right my plane to take some momentum out my descent.
          <br>As I came to a slower pace, I could hear nothing but the hard beating of my wild heart and the
          slow-moving currents washing below me. I was gliding. The Hienkel crashing towards the
          ocean, only the cargo ship beyond me.
          <br>I tried to kick the engine, nothing. I tried again and it sputtered. One more time and the engine
          kicked on. My left wing was near gone and the plane rocked back and forth I couldn’t get far. If I
          landed into the ocean I would no doubt be taken prisoner by the ship. I looked at the boat and
          aimed my nose for it. I expected it to fire at me, but nothing. I clicked my trigger, nothing.
          My time during this war, had made me a hellish thing. I could only think to crash my plane
          directly into the ship.
          <br>Mere moments ago I killed a pilot, one like me in spirit, yet I didn’t give a second thought to it.
          In another time they could be my friends but in this time they are my enemies. In that boat are
          people who once had dreams, who once loved. They are my age, they share the same experiences
          as me but as a consequence of being born hundreds of kilometers away, we are destined collide.
          The larger machinery consuming our souls. Looking at the cargo ship once more, it appeared as
          though my decision had already been made for me.
          <br>Gazing upon the distant skyline the sun started to sink below the horizon, I was nervous
          but I found comfort in the rhythmic heartbeat of the plane’s engine. Spotting my target with an
          uncertain sense of anticipation my hands unconsciously began to steer myself towards the ship,
          and my inevitable end. I felt a vague soreness beginning to creep into my body and it tensed. So
          began my final descent, casting the world into a somber darkness that transformed my
          surroundings making them insignificant to me. My mind had become infinite, a promise of
          something greater inviting me in its quarry into another realm. It was a surreal experience, and
          after it was all over I would have no further business in this world. As my last rays of
          consciousness flickered out; I could no longer feel my heartbeat. I knew my destination was
          close and I was scared.</p>
