      <p>In the late spring of last year, I lived at my school in an apartment just outside of campus. The
          day before I left it was 1:00PM on a Tuesday. I had slept through my first two classes and I had
          no intention to go to the third. I was awoken by my phone, a call from my mother. Not wanting
          to talk I silenced it. Across the screen it read:
          <br>Mom 4 missed calls
          <br>Dad 2 missed calls
          <br>Mom text message I need to talk with you could you please give me a call
          <br>I slumped back in my bed; I didn’t want to talk. A text from Sophie my sister,
          <br>Mom really needs to talk to you
          <br>Of course, they would use her. The perfect kid, she was all the way across the country at Brown
          being the perfect daughter while I was here wasting away flunking out of school. I remember
          wondering what the fuss was all about. Must be something important I thought. I dialed my
          mother. In one ring she picked up.
          <br>“Olivia” she said
          <br>“Hey, mom, sorry I didn’t get back to you earlier I was in class.” I said trying to sound as awake
          as possible. I began to pace around my room looking for something to wear.
          <br>“Oh, that's alright honey, how was class.”
        <br>“It was fine, er whatever. Sorry mom, I’m really busy, what did you need to talk to me about?”
          <br>“Olivia, honey, I-” her voice cracked, she paused trying to compose herself. I returned to my
          bed, sat down and imagined several scenarios that my mother could have been calling about.
          <br>“I … I, you see, well I went to the doctor a few weeks ago, and well I…”
          She told me she had cancer, something serious or not so serious. I can’t remember exactly what
          she said. Whatever the motherly thing to say was, is probably what she said. I left school the next
          day under the protest of my mother. I had to be with her I thought and getting an incomplete in
          my classes was an improvement to say the least. My friends understood and felt sorry for me, but
          I really didn’t know what to feel. I suppose I always thought that she would get through this and
          that I would go back to being a deadbeat student, having to hear about how great my sister was at
          every family reunion. My father would go back to texting me corny jokes. My mother would go
          back to calling me every day to check up on me. I would go back to not answering her. The first
          thought that popped into my head after my mother told me, was that it would get me out of
          school. I regret thinking that. I wished that my second thought, the worry I had for my mother,
          would have been my first.
          <br>So, I went back home. The next year that I spent with my mother and father made me
          closer with them then I had ever been. I had re-learned how to have conversations with them. My
          mom told me stories of her childhood, her time in school, everything she did before she had me
          which she called one of the happiest moments of her life. I could see the love she had for my
          sister and my love grew for her as well. My mother’s condition however only got worse by the
          day. Seeing her body deteriorate as the year went on made my heart sink. At first, she cut her
          hair short in preparation for the chemo and I did the same. And then it all fell off. The usual
          youthful jubilance of her face went away just like her hair. She had lost all of her appetite she
          didn’t want to eat or do much of anything anymore. My sister was away at Brown after my
          mother and father forced her to return. “It’s nothing you need to worry about” they both said.
          She wanted to be here, of course she did. She called everyday just to check on our mom. We
          tried to get her to do other things, 5ks, 10ks, every type of cancer charity event you can think of.
          She did them all of course. She wanted to be a superhero, like in all the articles we read about the
          people with the same condition as her, and she was. At least to me. Every day I witnessed her
          struggle and every day she put a smile on her face and told us “I love it all”. She did, she loved
          me, she loved my sister, she loved my father, she loved it all.
          <br>Over a year had passed, I had stayed with my mother never leaving her side. Sophie had
          returned home from Brown another successful semester for her of course, and my father
          continued to work at his day job. My mother always looked young for her age but now she had
          the wizened cadaverous look of a drug addict. No hair, her eyes had sunken into her now
          shapeless face. She still went through every day with a smile on her face, even if it was
          sometimes forced.
          <br>Sophie returned from Brown early today. She spent all morning and all afternoon with our
          mother. In the evening my mother took her nap as usual, just going through the day had become
          a monumental struggle for her. I took over all the cleaning duties that my mother could no longer
          preform. From the kitchen window I could see my mother walking up the driveway. He wore a
          look of drowsiness on his face as he approached the door. I went to open it for him and when the
          light hit his face all I could see was someone tired and defeated, not the usual jovial man that he
          was.
          <br>“Hey, dad” I said trying to get a read on his mood.
          <br>“Hey, hun” he said stepping into the doorway bags of Chinese takeout in each hand. He walked
          to the counter without ever looking at me setting the food down at the kitchen table. He let out a
          sigh while he unpacked the bags.
          <br>“Is everything alright Dad”
          <br>“Of course,” he said struggling to put a smile over his face.
          <br>I could tell something was wrong, I wanted to ask him why but before I could he asked me to
          call my mother and sister down for dinner. They came down. Sophie’s face was tired, perhaps
          since she hadn’t spent that much time with our mother in the past semester. She was not used to
          the deterioration of her condition. Seeing her the way she was now takes a lot out of me, I can
          only imagine how much it took out of her. I had grown used to her condition as time went on as I
          looked for normalcy in her anyway, to look past her debilitating condition.
          <br>We sat down, the smell of sweet and sour sauce and kung pao chicken permeated the room.
          Sophie and I started to eat, and she regaled us about her time at Brown, and some of the great
          people she had met there. My mother didn’t touch her food which wasn’t completely out of the
          usual, but neither did my father. This was uncommon since he normally ate more than all three
          of us combined. The table fell to silence as neither I nor my sister had more stories to tell. My
          father gave my mother a knowing look and she cleared her throat.
          <br>“I have something to say” she spoke with a clarity that I had not heard from her in years. Her
          voice was stern and soft all at the same time.
          “What is it mom?” Sophie asked her forked clanking against her plate as she sat it down. My
          mother’s gaze was piercing. Her face full of pain. She was clenching her lips trying to hold back
          something.
          <br>“I love you both,” her voice started trembling. “ very much, I want you both to know that, I am
          grateful for all the love and support you have given me this past year” Time felt like it was
          slowing down, all I could see was my mother, everything else had a become a blur. She spoke
          but I could no longer hear her, her eyes began to water and so did mine.
          Then her voice pierced through me again. “I’m giving up on my treatment” she calmly said,
          looking towards the ground. I could feel my heart trying to beat itself out my chest. I was dizzy I
          couldn’t believe what I was hearing. My father began rubbing her back trying to console her. The
          room began to spin. I felt like a deer caught in the headlights. Her words were ringing through
          my head affecting me down to my very core. My mother was giving up, doing the most selfish
          thing that anyone could do. Give up. Without regard to those around her. My mother began to
          weep as my father pulled her in. Her tears left a watery film over her ruined face. Sophie quickly
          got up and began embracing them, and they all wept together. Did they all know, how did they
          accept this so fast? I was angry, she was a coward, she was giving up like a loser. What about us,
          what about all the time we spent caring for her? What about me, what about the life I left so that
          I could look after her? Now all I could hear was these people in front of me making sounds that
          was getting on my nerves. My mother’s emaciated body in between my father and my sister was
          too much.
          <br>I got up from my chair, “So that's really it, HUH!” I screamed knocking back my chair.
          Sophie took a few steps towards me “Get the FUCK AWAY FROM ME!”
          <br>“Olivia please calm down…” My dad said “Your mother she…”
          <br>“She's a quitter!”
          <br>Raising my hand and pointed directly at my mother. “You gave up on us!”.
          <br>The cries of my name fell on deaf ears as I stormed to my room slamming the door behind me.
          My fingernails dug into my palm, rage gripping my chest, tears of frustration streaming down
          my face. Trying to calm myself I sat in my chair looking out the window. I was able to watch the
          sunset as the horizon gave birth to the night. Dark violet clouds standing sentinel over the world.
          The late evening light cast an aura of orange and purple, creating a mosaic of colors, as light
          bounced randomly off the objects in my room. Although, I was still confronted by the reality of
          everything that had just happened. I was overcome by what my mother had just said, or, what I
          had just done. A vague soreness crept into my body and it tensed. Only a moment ago I told a
          person that I love, my mother, that she was a quitter. In that moment I gave no second thoughts
          to what I said. The larger machinery of everything leading up to that moment consumed my soul.
          Once the sun had set the world felt like it had been cast into a somber darkness that transformed
          my surroundings making them insignificant to me. I wanted to think of something else, but my
          mind focused on one thing, what I had done to my mother. It was as though the blind rage had
          washed me clean. For the first time in that dark night, no stars or moon, I confronted the reality
          of the situation and the uncertainty of the future. All I knew was that I had to forgive my mother.
          Apologize for what I had done and realize that I could not change what had already happened.
          Overcome with longing, I began focusing my attention to the nothingness ahead. Then I saw the
          moon and an assortment of stars. There was no horizon where the earth met the sky, just a
          beautiful purple gradient.
          <br>The hardwood floors creaked as I leaned back in my chair. The morning was bright, and
          the birds chirped outside. I could feel the sun's warmth hugging me in a familiar embrace. I heard
          the door open and my sister walked in.
          <br>“Olivia” she said closing the door behind her. “What’s wrong with you? How could you do
          something like that to mom?” she said walking directly behind me, I felt like a kid in class when
          a teacher peers over their shoulder.
          <br>“I’m sorry” I said bringing my chair back on all fours.
          <br>“You shouldn’t be sorry to me, Olivia, you have to say sorry to mom.” her voice trembling. I
          realized how hard it probably was for her to come up here. She was my younger sister after all. I
          was supposed to be the one looking after her. As a sister and a daughter, I failed my family, over
          and over again. I had to stop this now.
          <br>“I know I fucked up, I’m sorry. I’m going down to talk to her and tell her I’m sorry too.” I got up
          from my chair to face my sister. She stood in front of me, still in yesterday’s clothes
          “How are you dealing with all this?” I asked her.
          <br>Turning towards the ground, she gulped trying to hold back her emotion. Her hair fell over face
          as she leaned against the wall to keep herself upright.
          <br>“It’s hard” she said quietly, biting her lips trying to get them to stop quivering. “Knowing that
          she will be gone soon.” she moved her hand over her eyes trying to hold back her tears to no
          avail. I pulled her in to me kissing the top of her head. “I know it’s hard.” I hugged her tighter.
          “really hard, but we have each other. I’ll always be there for you Sophie”
          <br>“I’ll always be there for you too” she said burying her head into my shoulder.
          <br>I smiled “Who knows you might be better at that, then me too.” She giggled momentarily
          breaking from her crying.
          <br>“I love you” she said wrapping her arms around me.
          <br>“I love you, too.” We stood there in each other’s arms crying. When I let her go, I brushed her
          hair to the side so that I could see her. Her eyes were red, and streaks from her tears ran down
          her face.
          <br>“I need to go see mom now” I said
          <br>She nodded, “She’s in the backyard now.”
          <br>“Alright” hugging her one last time before I left to go see my mom.
          <br>She was sitting on a bench in the backyard. Her body was small and skinny. Despite the
          warmth of the sun she was bundled up. I walked behind her and hugged her. She pulled me in,
          and I lay my head on her lap. She began to stroke my hair.
          <br>“I’m sorry,” I said.
          <br>“There is nothing to be sorry about.” She said stroking my hair. “Olivia, you had a perfectly
          natural reaction last night. I remember my mother died.”
          Her voice was warm and relaxed. She continued.
          <br>“I am so incredibly sorry to put you through this. I am sorry that I am going to die before you get
          a chance to really grow up. I just wanted to tell you that I did everything I could. I just can’t take
          it anymore. I would never have made it this far without you, your incredible love and support has
          gotten me through all this. I am just sorry that it didn’t work out. I am incredibly proud of you
          and everything you have done.”
          <br>As we both lay there my mom began to hum, and my eyes began to close. The sun's warmth
          hugging my face, I could hear the birds chirping as the leaves were stirred by the wind.</p>
